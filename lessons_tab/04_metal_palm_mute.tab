NOTES:
Classic metal palm mute riff pattern.

Power chord shapes:
E5 = E(0), A(2), D(2) - often played as open E
G5 = E(3), A(5), D(5)
A5 = E(5), A(7), D(7)

Technique:
- PM = Palm mute (rest palm edge on bridge)
- Mute the open E string notes heavily
- Let power chords ring slightly more
- Tight, controlled picking
- All down strokes (d) for aggressive sound

Practice tips:
- Start slower than 140 BPM
- Focus on muting consistency
- Keep right hand palm position steady
- Increase speed gradually

Variation: Try alternate picking (d-u-d-u) for different feel

LEGEND:
PM = palm mute
d = down stroke
0 = open string
5-5 = repeat fret 5 twice
