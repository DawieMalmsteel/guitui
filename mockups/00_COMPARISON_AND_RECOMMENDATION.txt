                    MOCKUP COMPARISON & RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

SUMMARY OF ALL MOCKUPS:

01_two_lines_below.txt       - Clean separation, 2 lines below fretboard
02_inline_unicode.txt         - Beautiful Unicode symbols inline
03_inline_ascii_safe.txt      - ASCII-safe inline (RECOMMENDED FOR COMPATIBILITY)
04_metal_palm_mute.txt        - Palm muting & rhythm techniques
05_tapping_exercise.txt       - Two-hand tapping notation
06_sweep_picking.txt          - Sweep arpeggio with direction
07_alternate_picking.txt      - Strict alternate picking pattern
08_hybrid_complex.txt         - Real-world multi-technique combo
09_minimal_focus.txt          - Minimalist current-beat focus

================================================================================

MY RECOMMENDATION: START WITH MOCKUP 3 (ASCII-safe inline)

WHY?
1. ✅ Works on ALL terminals (no Unicode issues)
2. ✅ Familiar to guitar players (standard tab notation)
3. ✅ Inline symbols keep technique with note
4. ✅ Just 1 line for picking below
5. ✅ Can copy/paste from online tabs
6. ✅ Easy to implement progressively

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:

PHASE 1: Basic (Start Here)
- Mockup 3: ASCII inline notation (b, /, \, h, p, ~)
- Single picking line below (d, u or ∏, V)
- Use existing technique detection we already coded

PHASE 2: Enhanced
- Add palm mute indicators (Mockup 4)
- Add hand indicators for tapping (Mockup 5)
- Color coding for techniques

PHASE 3: Advanced
- Sweep direction indicators (Mockup 6)
- Pattern recognition (Mockup 7)
- Complex combinations (Mockup 8)

PHASE 4: Polish
- Toggle modes (minimal vs full)
- Optional Unicode symbols
- Dynamic display based on space available

================================================================================

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS TO ADD:

User could toggle between modes:
[T] Tech display: OFF / INLINE / BELOW
[P] Pick display: OFF / SYMBOLS / LETTERS
[D] Detail level: MINIMAL / NORMAL / FULL

This gives flexibility for different use cases!

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review all mockup files
2. Choose which approach to start with
3. I'll implement Phase 1 first
4. Test and iterate
5. Add more features progressively
